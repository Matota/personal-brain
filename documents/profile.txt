My Personal Knowledge Assistant Plan

The Second Brain project is designed to be a local-first AI assistant.
It uses LangGraph for orchestration and Ollama for the LLM.
The goal is total privacy.

Work Schedule
I plan to spend mornings on ingestion and afternoons on agent tuning.
I prefer using Llama 3 for reasoning tasks.
